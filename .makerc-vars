# This is the FQDN of docker registry that is hosting the Catapult container image
# This can be the place where the CI/CD pipelines build your custom Catapult image or your own private registry proxy
# Set the value to the registry machine's FQDN
# Only HTTPS is supported so make sure that you are using a trusted certificates or Catapult trusts your CA (refer to README under customization section)
